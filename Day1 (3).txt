Difference between Batch Processing And Realtime Processing

Batch Processing			Realtime


Dealing with HISTORICAL data            Dealing with REALTIME data    

Mostly the input will be in the		The data will be stream data
form of file        

Processing may take hours !!!		Processing happens in microseconds to a second

Cloud Computing  --- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technologies - USA)
----------------

Cloud computing is a business term.

Delivery of IT or IT-enabled services over the Internet

As per NIST,

Cloud computing is a model that enables

	UBIQUITOUS (Any network / Any web-enabled device)
	ON-DEMAND (I can use my service anytime - 24/7/365 )
	CONVENIENT (No third party involvement to get the resources)

access to the shared pool of CONFIGURABLE computing resources that can be

	RAPIDLY PROVISIONED AND RELEASED 

with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.



Cloud Service and Deployment Models
-----------------------------------
As per NIST, there exists 3 service models and 4 deployment models


Service Models:

a. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

	- Hardware on Demand (Charge you based pay-per-usage model)
	- Provision yourself a Virtual Machine
		- RAM, DISK, CPU, GPU, OS, NETWORK
	- Deploy the VM to the user.


b. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
	
	- Provides platform mostly for developers
	- the infra side (virtual or physical) is managed by the cloud service provider	
	- platform side application are developed and managed by cloud user.

	e.g Heroku

c. SaaS (Software as a Service)

	- Targetted towards end user
	- Delivers softwares
	e.g. OneDrive, GDrive, GoogleDocs, GMail etc




Four Deployment Models
-----------------------

1. Private Cloud

	- Private setup restricted to a company/organization
	- Here the data and the hardware is owned by the company
	- Here all the maintenance is handled by the company

2. Public Cloud

	- Public service offering offered by service provider
	- Here service provider owns the hardware
	- Data is owned by user and service provider under some standards (ISO 9001-2000, ISO 									270001 )	
	- Uptime / Maintenance is handled by the service provider
	- Consumer consumes service by pay-per-use model.


3. Hybrid Cloud

	- Combination setup of Public and Private cloud
	- e.g. Data is stored at company infra
	       Processing is done in public cloud

4. Community Cloud
	
	- Private Setup used geographically in multiple offices
